            | The Camel task allows to send messages to and receive messages from Camel.
            | The Camel task is implemented as a Service Task and is defined by setting 'camel'
            | for the type of the service task.
            |
            | The Activiti Engine looks for a camelContext bean in the Spring container.
            | The camelContext bean defines the Camel routes that will be loaded by the Camel
            | container.
            +-->

        <!--+
            | The integration logic is all delegated to the Camel container, this has the advantage
            | that Activiti does not have to know anything about integration.
            +-->

        <!--+
            | Activiti simply activates a specific Camel Route that can be identified by the
            | Activiti process id='SimpleCamelCallProcess' appended with
            | the Activiti task id='simplecall'. In the CamelRoute the 'from' component
            | has the following format: 'from("activiti:SimpleCamelCallProcess:simpleCall")'
            |
            | Notice the format of the from endpoint. It is consisted of three parts:
            | 1. activiti              : refers to Activiti endpoint
            | 2. SimpleCamelCallProcess: name of the process
            | 3. simpleCall            : name of the Camel service in the process
            |
            | For more information read the *whole* section, from top to bottom about the
            | CamelTask here: http://activiti.org/userguide/index.html#bpmnCamelTask
